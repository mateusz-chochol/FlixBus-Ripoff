# FlixBus-Ripoff
Like the name suggests it's a bus travel website that tries to imitate FlixBus

It uses firebase as a hosting service: https://flixbus-production.web.app/ (demo so far)

As of now the things that work are: 
- login
- singup
- password reseting (it sends a message to the registered email)
- notifications
- routing (to the pages that already exist, which is: main page, login, signup, password reset)
- private routing (i.e. you cannot go to the login page if you are already logged in)
- and transitioning to mobile view on smaller screens
